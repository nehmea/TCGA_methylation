# TCGA_methylation
This repository includes the necessary files to perform differential methylation analysis of TCGA data. The code itself include functions to download the data directly from TCGA.
  
  1- The R code used in the analysis (Rcode_TCGA_DMP_Ezra.R)
  
  2- The differential methylation analysis results (TCGA-BRCA_DMP_TvsN.csv).
  
  3- I have also included a copy of the Methylation and clinical data used in this analysis as a zip file (TCGA-BRCA_Methylation data.zip).
