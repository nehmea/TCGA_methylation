# TCGA_methylation
This repository includes the necessary files to perform differential methylation analysis of TCGA data. The code itself has functions that download the data directly from TCGA. I have also included a copy of the data used in this analysis as a zip file.

  1- Methylation and clinical data (TCGA-BRCA_Methylation data.zip)
  
  2- The R code used in the analysis (Rcode_TCGA_DMP_Ezra.R)
  
  3- The differential methylation analysis results (TCGA-BRCA_DMP_TvsN.csv).
